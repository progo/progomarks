progomarks
----------

Bookmarks with quick UI, like what Vimperator et al. does: throw a
couple of letters to denote each file and you only need to type those
in in order to open that one up.

(Something like "fastmarks" would probably apply as the name.)


Install
-------

- save this file in "~/.emacs.d/elisp"
- in your ".emacs" add the following:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/elisp")
    (require 'progomarks)



Usage
-----

Edit the file under variable `progomarks-file' (default
"~/.emacs.d/progomarks") and add URIs to it, line by line. Most
accessed first.

You may use a command "progomarks-mark-current-file" to add currently
visible  file to the file storage.

Open the bookmarks listing with command "progomarks".
There you can bury the buffer with "q".


Customize
---------

The following variables are waiting for you to customize them:

- progomarks-file (default "~/.emacs.d/progomarks"):
  The file containing the bookmarks, one per line.

- progomarks-alphabet (default "jklfa"):
  The pool of keys that are used to create quick keys.

- progomarks-endkey (default "w"):
  The key that always ends the shortcut. (Needed for cover for Emacs'
  submap handling.) If you decide to use a non-single-letter key such
  as "SPC" as the end key, please prefix the variable with a space.
  For example, " SPC".
